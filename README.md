This project is a machine learning project aiming to train a model able to adequately predict an association (with >75% accuracy) based on publically available data.
We were keen to evaluate the labour market and the impact of employment upon discretionary expenditure.

Datasets:
Obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are:
1. Labour Force - https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release#data-downloads
2. Lending Indicators - https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/finance/lending-indicators/latest-release#data-downloads

Both datasets are available under the Creative Commons Attribution Internation Licence 4.0, whereby the ABS is the original creator of this data and does not endorse this project.

Question to answer:
----------

Can a machine learning model predict the total amount of committed travel loans based upon economic indicators?
Total travel loans committed as a surrogate for spending on non-essential items / discretionary expenditure.

Data Handling/ETL:
Data tables were cleaned, merged and checked for duplicates and null values. nil existed
Data required normalisation and standarisation prior to development of the model

Dates from 01-2015 -> 09-2024 (limit of data from Travel Loans)

Model Features from the data sets:
1. Employed Males (Full Time)
2. Employed Females (Full Time)
3. Employment-To-Population Ratio (Males)
4. Employment-To-Population Ratio (Females)
5. Food Spend (Household)
6. Clothing & Footwear Spend (Total)

Model choice:
As Month as a categorical variable, and opted to choose Random Forest Regressor Modelling with hyperparameter tuning.
We later encoded this variable, but did not pursue a linear regression approach (linear regression not suitable for string/categorical variables).

Metrics:
RÂ² Score	0.794	
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)	5.96
MSE (Mean Squared Error)	60.04	
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)	7.75	
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)	39.14%	

The model has a reasonable R2 score. However, it is clear there is a large error margin, and therefore it is not yet optimised.
As such, further hyperparameter tuning was performed to see if this improves on the metrics.

Post hyperparameter tuning there are minor improvements in the model across all metrics indicating better predictive power.

You can see key features in this model focus on Full Time Employment for females, Employment-to-population ratio for males, Full-time Employment for males and Food expenditure.
