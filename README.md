----------

This project is a machine learning project aiming to train a model able to adequately predict an association (with >75% accuracy) based on publically available data.
We were keen to evaluate the labour market and the impact of employment upon discretionary expenditure (we used travel loans as a proxy measure for this).

Datasets:
Obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics

----------
Data tables were cleaned, merged and checked for duplicates.
Data required normalisation and standarisation prior to development of the model

ML model chosen - Random Forest and Hyperparameters

We chose model based upon the feature set (6 chosen features) and data types. 
We felt that linear regression was not going to adequately provide insight into this association.
